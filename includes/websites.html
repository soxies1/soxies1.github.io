			<h2 class="section-title">Random Questions Survey</h2>
			<p class="section-content">This project was a site where users would answer and add random questions that had two answers. Based on the users answers to questions, the user would be given a score determining how much of either a conformist or individual they are. Basically, if they gave the answer most chosen, they'd move more towards the conformist end of the scale, where if it was the minority vote, they would move towards the individual end of the scale. </p>

			<h2 class="section-title">Study Buddy</h2>
			<p class="section-content">A forum for students to meet up with other students at their university in the same course as them to study with. Very simple design as users would basically put a post on the forum tagged with the course theyre studying, and other users would then reply on it. Tyson made this site to learn the MEAN stack when he was first introduced to web development. </p>
