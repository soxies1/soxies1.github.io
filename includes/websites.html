			<h2 class="section-title">Random Questions Survey</h2>
			<p class="section-content">This project was a site where users would answer and add random questions that had two answers. Based on the users answers to questions, the user would be given a score determining how much of either a conformist or individual they are. Basically, if they gave the answer most chosen, they'd move more towards the conformist end of the scale, where if it was the minority vote, they would move towards the individual end of the scale. </p>
