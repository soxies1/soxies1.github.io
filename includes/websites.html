			<h2 class="section-title">OpenCode.me</h2>
			<p class="section-content">For NwHacks 2017, we wanted to make open source easier to get into with for beginner developers, so we made OpenCode.me. A place where developers can share ideas or even projects they have started to collaborate on, but also will setup the required development environment per project for you. All that's required is a Github account and to docker installed, and you can have almost any development environment ready in as little as 2 steps.</p>

			<h2 class="section-title">Random Questions Survey</h2>
			<p class="section-content">This project was a site where users would answer and add random questions that had two answers. Based on the users answers to questions, the user would be given a score determining how much of either a conformist or individual they are. Basically, if they gave the answer most chosen, they'd move more towards the conformist end of the scale, where if it was the minority vote, they would move towards the individual end of the scale. </p>

			<p class="section-content">A forum for students to meet up with other students at their university in the same course as them to study with. Very simple design as users would basically put a post on the forum tagged with the course theyre studying, and other users would then reply on it. This site was made to learn the MEAN stack upon an initial introduction to web development. </p>
